**C# Microsoft SQL Architect TEST**

Requirements:
Use Azure Data Factory (or alternate option if better) to extract data from a source system, transform the data, and load it into the SQL database.
Use SQL to design and implement a schema for the database, including tables, indexes, and stored procedures.
Use C# to develop an application that interacts with the database, including implementing the following features:
A command-line interface (CLI) that allows the user to initiate and monitor ETL pipelines, search the data using Azure Cognitive Search, and search for products using all available parameters.
Code to handle errors and exceptions, and to log application events.
Code to optimize SQL queries and database design for performance and scalability.
Code to implement CDC to capture specific changes to the data in the database and write them out to another database.
Use Azure Cognitive Search to provide enhanced search capabilities for the data in the SQL database.
Implement CDC (or alternate option if better) to capture specific changes to the data in the SQL database and write them out to another database.

There are several tools that can be used to generate large amounts of data for importing into a database. Here are a few options:
Microsoft SQL Server Data Generator: This is a tool provided by Microsoft that can be used to generate test data for SQL Server databases. It can generate data in a variety of formats, including CSV, XML, and JSON.
Data Factory: Azure Data Factory can be used to generate and populate test data into the database tables. Using ADF, you can define your own data flow pipelines to read data from different sources like CSV, JSON, SQL Server, etc., transform the data, and write it to the destination tables.
PowerShell: PowerShell scripts can be used to generate data for importing into the database. You can use scripts to generate test data in a variety of formats, including CSV, XML, and JSON.
